Introduction
============

Wgsim is a small tool for simulating sequence reads from a reference genome.
It is able to simulate diploid genomes with SNPs and insertion/deletion (INDEL)
polymorphisms, and simulate reads with uniform substitution sequencing errors.
It does not generate INDEL sequencing errors, but this can be partly
compensated by simulating INDEL polymorphisms.

Wgsim outputs the simulated polymorphisms, and writes the true read coordinates
as well as the number of polymorphisms and sequencing errors in read names.
One can evaluate the accuracy of a mapper or a SNP caller with wgsim_eval.pl
that comes with the package.


Compilation
===========

gcc -g -O2 -Wall -o wgsim wgsim.c -lz


History
=======

Wgsim was modified from MAQ's read simulator by dropping dependencies to other
source codes in the MAQ package and incorporating patches from Colin Hercus
which allow to simulate INDELs longer than 1bp. Wgsim was originally released
in the SAMtools software package. I forked it out in 2011 as a standalone
project. A few improvements were also added in this course.
